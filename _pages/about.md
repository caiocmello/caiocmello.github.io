### About me

I am currently a Research Fellow at the Center for Advanced Internet Studies ([CAIS](https://www.cais-research.de/fellows/caio-mello/) and a Ph.D. student in Digital Humanities at the [School of Advanced Study](https://research.sas.ac.uk/search/staff/1581/mr-caio-mello/), University of London. I hold a BA in Journalism and a MA in Communication, both from the Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, Brazil. I worked over the last four years at the School of Advanced Study, University of London, as an early-stage researcher where I joined the EU-funded Horizon 2020 project [CLEOPATRA](http://cleopatra-project.eu/), under the Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Innovative Training Network. 

I have worked as visiting researcher at the [UK Web Archive](https://blogs.bl.uk/webarchive/2021/07/londons-olympic-legacy-local-national-and-international-aspirations.html)/British Library and [VICO Research & Consulting](https://vico-research.com/). I currently collaborate with [Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org/pt/licoes/analise-sentimento-exploracao-dados) as reviewer and translator.  


### My research

### - at CAIS

_Interpreting sentiment analysis outputs to categorise emotions in news articles_

Sentiment analysis (SA) is one of the techniques commonly used in Natural Language Processing. These algorithms classify words in a scale of sentiment that usually goes from negative to positive. These techniques have been mostly applied to twitter data or customer feedback to track reception of products. However, researchers in the humanities have been using the algorithms to explore other kinds of text, such as news articles to understand the tone in which some media events are narrated. This kind of use of the SA present several challenges. Questions arise on to what extent the SA scores are reliable or how they can be used for interpretation (qualitative analysis) and discourse analysis. This project aims to investigate how these techniques have been applied to the study of media events, identifying its limitations and potentialities, making use of explainable AI and qualitative analysis of SA outputs in a multilingual text corpus.

### - PhD research

This research is part of the CLEOPATRA project, which aims to explore major events that influence and shape our lives and our societies through advanced cross-lingual processing of textual and visual information.  

My project _Nationalism, internationalism and sporting identity: the London and Rio Olympics_ explores the media coverage of the Olympic Games in a cross-cultural, cross-lingual and temporal perspective. I'm especially interested in comparing how the concept of 'Olympic legacy' has been approached by the Brazilian and British media considering different locations, languages and social-political contexts. This research is conducted under the supervision of [Professor Jane Winters](https://research.sas.ac.uk/search/staff/126/professor-jane-winters) and [Martin Steer](https://research.sas.ac.uk/search/staff/405/mr-marty-steer/). 

My main research interests lie in the fields of digital methods, Natural Language Processing techniques (NLP), data visualisation, media studies, urban studies and digital activism.
