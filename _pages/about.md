### About me

I am a PhD student in Digital Humanities at the [School of Advanced Study](https://www.sas.ac.uk/digital-humanities/dhrh/people/mello), University of London. I also hold the post of editor of the [Programming Historian in English](https://programminghistorian.org/en/project-team).

I hold a BA in Journalism and a MA in Communication, both from the Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, Brazil. I have been employed as an early-stage researcher (2019 - 2023) at the School of Advanced Study, University of London, where I joined the EU-funded Horizon 2020 project [CLEOPATRA](http://cleopatra-project.eu/), under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Innovative Training Network. I've also been a research fellow at the Center for Advanced Internet Studies ([CAIS](https://www.cais-research.de/fellows/caio-mello/)) in Bochum, Germany (2018 and 2023). During my PhD, I worked as a visiting researcher at the [UK Web Archive](https://blogs.bl.uk/webarchive/2021/07/londons-olympic-legacy-local-national-and-international-aspirations.html)/British Library and [VICO Research & Consulting](https://vico-research.com/). 

Alongside my main activities as a researcher, I sporadically write [news stories](https://www.clippings.me/caiocmello). My main interests as a journalist are history and the arts. I have also been engaged in translation and revisions (Portuguese-into-English & English-into-Portuguese). I have translated [lessons](https://programminghistorian.org/pt/licoes/analise-sentimento-exploracao-dados) for the Programming Historian and revised museum labels for the Ricardo Brennand Institute (Recife, Brazil). When not reading, writing or coding, I'm usually playing music or looking for a nice pool in the area to jump in.

### My research
My main research interests lie in the fields of digital methods, Natural Language Processing techniques (NLP), data visualisation, media studies, urban studies and digital activism. 

- ### PhD research

_Nationalism, internationalism and sporting identity: the London and Rio Olympics_

My research explores the media coverage of the Olympic Games in a cross-cultural, cross-lingual and temporal perspective. I'm especially interested in comparing how the concept of 'Olympic legacy' has been approached by the Brazilian and British media considering different locations, languages and social-political contexts. This research is conducted under the supervision of [Professor Jane Winters](https://research.sas.ac.uk/search/staff/126/professor-jane-winters) and [Martin Steer](https://research.sas.ac.uk/search/staff/405/mr-marty-steer/). The study is part of the CLEOPATRA project, which aims to explore major events that influence and shape our lives and our societies through advanced cross-lingual processing of textual and visual information.
