### Paper | Facebook Event as a platform to promote engagement in social movements: Theory of performativity applied to social networks
<br/>
About: This paper reflects on the application of the Theory of Performativity in complex communication processes emerged from the Social Networks. Austin’s (1975) theory of Speech Acts and the concept of Performativity stated by Butler (1997) are used to develop mechanisms of analysis in utterances that are intrinsic to the Facebook Events' page.
